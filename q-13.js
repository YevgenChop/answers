/* question:
How do you test in your unit tests to see if the correct properties are being passed to child components.

answer:
This can be checked through the snapshot of the component.
You need to make a snapshot of the parent component and the children component.
You need to choose the part with the required component from the parent and compare it with the reference fragment. 
So we can find out it by doing this.
