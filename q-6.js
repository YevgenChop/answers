/* question:
In your own words, explain css specificity.

answer:
CSS Specificity is the set of the specific rules applied to CSS selectors in order to determine which style is applied to an element. 
The more specific a CSS style is, the higher point value it accrues, and the likelier it is to be present on the element's style.
