/* question:
In your own words, explain, what is ‘!important’ in css.  Also how does it work?  
Are there any special circumstances when using it, where it’s behaviour might not be what you expect?


answer:
When we use overlapping styles, css prioritizes those styles. By default, the last style will be used. But the important keyword allows us to override the order of styles. 
Such an operator should be used in exceptional situations when we cannot influence the order of styles.
